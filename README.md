## Background

I have a deep interest in audio and what attracts humans to different characteristics of songs and podcasts. I want to model those musical attributes and how those affect popularity in various ways. I brought together data from many different sources (webscraping, APIs, Spotify, Genius, Kaggle) and hope to bring a unique approach to measuring popularity and what causes it.

From that research, then we can make some predictions for the upcoming 2021 Grammy Awards based on past winners and the musical attributes of this year's nominees.

## The Project
Some skills I demonstrate in this project
  - cleaning and transforming messy data
  - data modeling popularity (using regression) and genres (classification)
  - gleaning nonobvious insights based on subject matter expertise
  - webscraping and utilizing APIs
  - visualizing time series
  - getting to the "so what" - moving from the data to decisions-making (in this case, making financial bets on the Grammy Awards)
