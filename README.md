## Background

I have a deep interest in audio and what attracts humans to different characteristics of songs and podcasts. I want to model those musical attributes and how those affect popularity in various ways. I brought together data from many different sources (webscraping, APIs, Spotify, Kaggle) and hope to bring a unique approach to measuring popularity and what causes it.

<br>

## The Project
Some skills I demonstrate in this project
  - cleaning and transforming messy data
  - engineering features and bringing in data that does not seem to be related on its surface
  - gleaning nonobvious insights based on subject matter expertise
  - answering interesting questions 
  - webscraping and utilizing APIs
